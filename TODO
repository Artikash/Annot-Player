## FIXME
- windows xp
  - check if it is possible to bypass apploc on Chinese Windows XP

- player
  - fixme: open from explorer cannot resolve subtitle
    - it must because current directory changed
  - fixme: infinite retry downloading annotations
- downloader
  BUG: the way to get next taskId in downloader is incorrect
  - debug downloader
    - start single task when running
    - delete single task when running
    - add/delete/start/stop multiple task
    - add multiple task without waiting
- player
  - fixme: annotationview contextmenu/doubleclick might crash
- common
  - add background to spinbox and timeedit
- windows fixme
  - player
    - debug close video crash

## LATER
- backlog
  - betterway to show game text
    - highlight diff words, etc
    - hover with meanings

- windows game
  - submit game text as context as well
  - flag it's already finished, or locked.
  - directly edit translations
  - a different way to display galgame text with phrases splitted
  - Able to manually dumping galgame and upload text online.
    - redisign database, diveup pos, add textid
      game_text
      text_id
    - split media_token into media_xxx and game_xxx in the future
    - split media_annot and game_annot
    - upload game text for subtitles/annotations as well
  - cache google translation for offline subtitle annot, or use a db for translation?
  - game_text
    text_id token_id user_id text_create_time text_create_ip text_text
  was thinking to add something like a universal user dictionary for names/expressions or even complete phrases that are most common used in games so it gets immediately translated, as an example of a user dictionary there is http://www.hongfire.com/forum/showthread.php/79006-fhc-dictionary-of-ATLAS-Japanese-Translator or http://www.hongfire.com/forum/showthread.php/94395-Translation-Aggregator-v0-4-9?p=2269439#post2269439
  I see. Sharing translation efforts across different games is really a good idea!

- new features
 - Group of people could share annotations/ or rename group as circle
 - Multiple chat rooms, at least per game
 - Also having on the site an universal translated text bank of the most common used phrases, expressions or names present on games (like a user dictionary) that can be easily accessed by all the people would be awesome. This way you can choose when playing whatever game, and even if there isn't any notes available for it, to use the universal bank so the most well-known Japanese expressions/names/phrases that Annot Player detects present on the universal bank are displayed accordingly.
