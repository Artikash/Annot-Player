       local sound server: ssh -L 5901:localhost:5901 -L 1234:localhost:1234 <remote sound client>
       remote sound client: mkfifo output.wav
       remote sound client: parec | sox -t raw -r 44100 -s -L -b 16 -c 2 - "output.wav" & cat output.wav | nc -l 1234
       local sound server: mkfifo fifo.wav
       local sound server: paplay --volume=48000 -v fifo.wav & nc localhost 1234 >fifo.wav

       As you can see, I use port 5901 for VNC and port 1234 to forward sound. The only thing is it takes at least 30 seconds before it plays on the speakers.

        Any ideas why such a huge latency? I am guessing it has something to do with parec.

    - wine

- tweak openssh client and server source code for speedup
  - disable encryption
  - increase buffer
  - use more than pipelined connections
  - stream sound/picture in other service
